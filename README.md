# Project Name

Movie Seat Booking

# Project Description

Javascript project that allows the user to choose seats for a selected movie
title and changes the selected seats to occupied upon clicking a submit button.

# Why I Built It

Practice on creating objects and arrays and accessing the data in the
objects and arrays, even data that is nested. Being able to display the data
correctly.

# What I Would Do Next

I would add another section for concessions to get popcorn, candy and beverages.

# What I Learned

I learned that I need work with objects and arrays, especially those that
are nested. I need to break my code down into smaller steps and to write
psuedo code before I start actually coding.

# How To Use It

Select a movie title that you wish to see and then select your seats from
the remaining seats that are available. Once you have selected your seats
click on the submit button so your seats become occupied.
